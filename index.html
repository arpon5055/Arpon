             <h1>I'm Arpon Saha Joy</h1> —
A passionate student, musician, and dedicated volunteer.

Currently, I'm a Class 11 student at Narayanganj College, with a strong interest in creativity, learning, and helping others. I've been learning and playing the guitar for over 3 years, exploring music as a powerful form of expression and joy.

Alongside my academic and musical journey, I'm proud to be an active volunteer with the Red Crescent Youth Narayanganj. Over the past year, I've contributed to various humanitarian and community activities. I'm trained in First Aid, Psychological First Aid, Anticipatory Action, Climate Change Adaptation, Nature-Based Solutions, and more — always eager to make a positive impact.

Welcome to my world — where music, learning, and service come together.

            <h1>My Journey at Biddyaniketon School (2012–2024)</h1>
            From the very first day I stepped into the gates of Biddyaniketon School in 2012, to the emotional farewell in 2024 — this place was more than just a school to me. It was my second home. Over the span of 12 long years, I didn’t just grow up academically, I grew up as a person. Every classroom, corridor, and corner of the school holds memories I deeply cherish.

I was a proud member of the SSC Batch of 2024 — a batch full of energy, dreams, and, of course, mischief. I was known among my friends and teachers not just for leading from the front, but also for being the mastermind behind many fun moments and playful chaos. Whether it was organizing group activities, pulling off light-hearted pranks, or simply bringing smiles to people’s faces — those memories make me smile to this day.

Biddyaniketon wasn’t just a part of my childhood — it shaped me. And no matter where life takes me, a big part of me will always belong to those unforgettable school days.

            <h1>An Intermediate Level GUitarist</h1>
        I have been learning guitar for almost <b>three years</b> and have performed in many shows during this time. Music has become a big part of my life, and I'm still learning and improving every day. Currently, I consider myself an intermediate-level guitarist, and I always look forward to exploring new styles, techniques, and collaborations. Playing guitar not only brings me joy but also helps me express myself in ways words often can't.

            I have been an active volunteer of the Red Crescent Youth, Narayanganj unit, for a long time. Being part of this humanitarian organization has been a life-changing experience for me.

        <h2>What is life?!</h2>
        <p>Life is nothing but a fleeting journey between birth and death — a path we all must walk, uncertain of its length but rich in moments. From our first breath to our last, we experience joy, pain, love, loss, growth, and decay. It is not the destination that defines us, but the choices we make along the way, the connections we form, and the meaning we find in even the smallest of experiences. Life teaches us that everything is temporary — success, sorrow, youth, time — and in this impermanence lies its beauty. To truly live is to embrace the present, learn from the past, and walk forward without fear of the inevitable end, knowing that the journey itself is what matters most.</p>

           <h2>Hotel California</h2>
           <p>I once performed the iconic song Hotel California live on stage. It was an unforgettable experience, especially because I played the famous guitar solo from the track, which is considered one of the greatest solos of all time. That moment was truly special for me as a guitarist, and the audience’s response made it even more memorable.</p>

Even though I haven’t been part of this unit for a very long time, it already feels like home. The bond we've built through working side by side in every situation is truly special.
